Display text should show what is being input
    Display content = button pressed
    Function to pick up pressed number into value
    should it be an array that gets joined and made into a number?
    Or i could store both in an object
    And either this array.join() gets sent to display or the object property is read

number 2 should always be cleared up and their operation result stored in num 1
